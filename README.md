# dot-files

For now it just has my .bash-profile. I find this alias'es that work better for me. Any comment is appreciated.

**I'm using a mac, so... I'm not using bashrc**

## Install Requirements
First of all I have python 3 installed for some of the scripts I wrote before I started learning bash scripting. I'm not gonna write those in bash. Quod scripsi, scripsi.
